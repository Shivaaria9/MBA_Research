On the positive side, 20 pounds gone and I feel like a different person and I'm only halfway to my goal. my A1C dropped from 7.7 to 6.0 and my doctor is thrilled - my endocrinologist is really pleased.

But it hasn't been all smooth sailing. the nausea is real and it can be debilitating at times throughout the day. I've thrown up a few times, which is definitely not fun throughout the day. digestive slowdown is real - constipation is annoying which gets worse as the week goes on.

Found that crackers and bland foods makes it more tolerable. I'm told the side effects usually get better after a few weeks.
