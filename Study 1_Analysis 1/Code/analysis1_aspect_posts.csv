"After half a year using Ozempic for Type 2 Diabetes, here's my honest review: I'm 46 years old and have struggled with obesity for years.

"Quick check-in after 4 months on this medication:

The results have been amazing - I'm finally not thinking about food 24/7.

But it hasn't been all smooth sailing. had some vomiting issues, especially if I eat too much especially in the mornings. nausea hits me hard, particularly in the mornings it seems to come in waves.

For me, these results are absolutely worth the discomfort. I'm staying committed to seeing this through.

Hope this helps someone considering it.",[],['nausea']
"Just wanted to give an update after 6 weeks on Ozempic.

I have to say the benefits are real - feeling more energetic than I have in years.

However, there are definitely some challenges. tiredness is a real issue I'm working through throughout the day.

I'm handling it by prescription anti-nausea meds. The trade-off is worth it when I see the progress.

Still figuring this out but staying hopeful. This sub has been so helpful for me.",[],['nausea']

The downsides I'm experiencing: dealing with persistent nausea - some days are worse than others throughout the day.

Anyone else experiencing similar things?",[],['nausea']

"I started my Ozempic journey 8 months ago and honestly,

I have to say the benefits are real - the fatigue I used to feel is mostly gone.

The side effects though... they're real. the nausea is real and it can be debilitating at times particularly in the first 2-3 days after injection.

Using ginger tea and small frequent meals to cope and it's working okay. The trade-off is worth it when I see the progress. I keep reminding myself why I started this.

Would love to hear others' experiences!",[],"['nausea', 'fatigue', 'injection_site']"

On the plus side: lost 22 lbs so far and people are starting to notice. My clothes fit better and I have more energy

However, the side effects have been significant. headaches have been more frequent since starting. Some days are worse than others.
